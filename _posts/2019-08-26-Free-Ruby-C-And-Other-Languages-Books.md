Hello Dragon Riders, today I bring you some books that were made from Stack Overflow Documentation before it was shutdown.

They are very good books to be free if you already know how to program. You can learn a language pretty fast with them because they go directly to the point.

They aren't perfect though, they can have some typos, and they can be repetitive in some parts sometimes. Also, they aren't totally up to date, but better than most resources out there.

Everything said, I'm pretty sure they are going to be useful to you, so here they are:

- [Ruby Notes For Professionals Book](https://goalkicker.com/RubyBook/)
- [C Notes For Professionals Book](https://goalkicker.com/CBook/)

Why C and not only Ruby? Because DragonRuby Game Toolkit is made internally with C, and it could be useful sometime in the future.

These other books are for other languages, but they could be useful to you also, so I let them here:
